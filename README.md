# CSharp wow launcher by STDASP
C# Wow Launcher

Hello guys!

It so happened that it was prepared for a project that never started. So I share it with you.
-This launcher was written by himself using C#.
-This launcher was not stolen, rewritten or anything else like that. It was written from scratch and independently.
-The source code contains both smart solutions and "quick release".

-Go to the functionality:
-Patching client memory to run
-Implementation of the configuration system (JSON - custom objects)
-Implementation of authorization/registration system
-Updating the interface
-Update hasher, the settings, utilities, software update.
-Extension of the functionality of listing servers
-Implementing native functions
-Custom system "alerts"
-API module fixes
-Code cleaning/refactoring
-API
-Multithreading
-Multilanguage
-Beautiful design
-Download news, with support for caching system
-Custom configuration system, with the possibility of (de-)serialization
-Support for architectural patterns (Singleton, Facade)
-Qualitative decomposition and implementation of submodules
-End-to-end encryption (with my submodule IX.Spider)
-Native file system modules
-Caching of work windows
-Asynchronous operation of critical modules (logging, etc.)
-Automatic update
-Smart check of the game client




I understand that this will be the same in the hands of not very nice people, but I don't care.
For me it is important that maybe it can be useful to people who have knowledge and understanding of what they do.
